# Getting Started

There are many ways to get involved with the project. If you have a new and exciting feature, or even a simple bugfix, simply [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), create some simple test cases, [generate a pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) and give yourself credit!

If you've never worked on a GitHub project, [this is a good piece](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source) for getting started.
